    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This gobi Manchurian is one of my favorite 
        gobi, or cauliflower, recipes that is 
        available at many Indo Chinese-style 
        restaurants.

    <p>
      It is a spicy dish that's sure 
        to leave your family wanting more! 
        Occasionally, I even love to bake the cauliflower to lower the calories. 
        Remember, baking will take away from the crispiness of fried cauliflower.
