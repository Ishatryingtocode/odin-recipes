# odin-recipes
A beginner level project to test my html and git skills. Through this project I learnt basic html skills like how to add links, images, headings etc. and git skills such as add, commit and push files into GitHub.

A simple website "Recipes" to make my favourite food items. The home page has links to the recipes.
